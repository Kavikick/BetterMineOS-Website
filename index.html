            You might not believe this was created by Kavikick or not but it was.
            I noticed not many of you downloaded the torrent so I thought I'd make a website for you to download it from
        </p>
        <p>
            Warning! It is 13.1GB and at half a MB/s it'll take 7.278hrs for it to download..
            This assuming that you are the only person downloading it as well! If two people are downloading it'll
            take twice as long!
            The faster route would be to use the torrent to download it which should take an hour or two.
        </p>
        <p>
            You're choice! That's not even to mention that the website download could fail and then you're really
            in trouble because then you'll have to redownload the whole thing. Lol only subtle hints here ;)
